<h2><a id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p>It has very forcibly been brought home to me
that not only young officers joining their units
from training establishments, but also those
who have been in France and have come back
wounded, are often very ignorant on those points
in minor tactics which they have not learnt
through actual experience on the battlefield, and
that this is especially the case with regard to
the proper control of fire. The battlefield is an
expensive place to acquire knowledge which can
be gained elsewhere, and it behooves us to do
all we possibly can to train our young commanders
under peace conditions for the ordeals
they will have to encounter in the presence of
the enemy.</p>

<p>Training which in ordinary times would form
the course of study for years now has to be
crammed into a few months, and it stands to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
reason that much which is essential remains
unlearnt.</p>

<p>I have generally found that the best way to
train young officers in minor tactics is by giving
them as realistically as possible little problems
to solve, and afterwards in the presence of
their comrades to discuss their proposed dispositions
and then to tell them clearly what they
ought to have done, giving reasons for every
step taken.</p>

<p>Where it is possible actually to carry out the
exercise with troops, this is still better, so long
as it is all done quickly, as this impresses the
lesson to be learnt more strongly on the minds
of the students.</p>

<p>Many men who are in other ways excellent
instructors have not the facility for constructing
problems with <em>a point</em>, and this being the
case, it has occurred to me that I may be generally
helping the training of young officers by
publishing these letters which are written in
continuation of those I addressed to my son on
obtaining his commission. The importance of
the subject with which they deal is self-evident.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii">vii</a></span>
Unless the arrow-head, the platoon, be sharp,
that is, unless the leader be skilful as well as
brave, the little combat will not be won, and it
is the sum of the little combats which spells the
result of the battle.</p>

<p>There is not a word in this little book which
transgresses the spirit of the training manuals
and official instructions now in force.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<i>December 1, 1917.</i></p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">My dear Dick</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>It is now nearly nine months since I wrote
the last of my letters of advice to you, and since
then you have yourself been in France and have
had many experiences and hairbreadth escapes.</p>

<p>I am very thankful that your wound is only a
slight one, and am glad that within a couple
of months you will probably once more be able
to take your place in the fighting-line, for that
is where your country demands your presence.
It behoves you, in the meantime, to seize every
opportunity of studying your profession and familiarising
yourself as far as possible with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
different positions in which you may be placed,
so that when you meet a similar situation in the
field you may recognise it for what it really is, in
spite of the surroundings in which it is dressed,
and may thus be more likely to solve it properly
than would be the case if you were dealing with a
problem which you had never thought over before.
It would be difficult to exaggerate the
importance of the results which may depend on
your correctly answering the questions put to
you on the field of battle. These questions become
more complex and more varied as the responsibility
of an officer’s position increases, but
in the case of a junior officer they are seldom
very difficult, and all that is required to deal
with them properly is a little common sense and
a cool head combined with courage and determination.</p>

<p>It is on the result of the many little fights of
which an action is composed that the result of a
battle depends. The brilliant strategy of a commander-in-chief
and the fine tactics of a divisional
commander cannot bear fruit unless the
troop-leading of the companies is well carried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>
out, and in the same way good troop-leading will
prevent a defeat being turned into a rout. Individual
gallantry, valuable as it may be, is bound
to be thrown away if unaccompanied by skill.
The experiences you have undergone should
render you more capable of assimilating the
requisite knowledge than you were nine months
ago.</p>

<p>Before I proceed further, I will mention a few
axioms which can seldom be neglected without
bad results accruing. Some of these seem so
self-evident that it would appear to be unnecessary
to state them, nevertheless they are all of
them continually transgressed.</p>

<p>1. Impress on your men the importance of
adjusting their sights correctly. On a peace
field-day this axiom is sometimes neglected, and
in the excitement of action it is often entirely
forgotten.</p>

<p>2. Keep your men together unless there is
some very definite object for not doing so, and
only detach them for protective services, <i>i.e.</i>
advance guards, etc.</p>

<p>3. Infantry mounted officers are apt to forget<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
that their horses are given to them in order to
give them more mobility. There are many occasions
on which, by cantering on and making arrangements
previous to the arrival of the unit
which they command, they can save a great deal
of valuable time and often much marching and
counter-marching.</p>

<p>4. Never allow the pace in front to be hurried
on a march. It is much easier to march
at the head than at the rear of a column.</p>

<p>5. Before opening fire, carefully consider the
situation. If you feel certain of being able to
deal with the enemy, let him approach close
before disclosing yourself, and then destroy him.
If, on the contrary, he is so much superior to
you that you cannot hope to be able to do this,
you should open at a long range, but in these
circumstances do not hurry the rate of fire to
begin with. It takes an exceptional man to fire
more than 200 rounds in a short space of time
without being shaken.</p>

<p>6. It is a sound rule always to pursue the
line of action which your opponent does not wish
you to pursue. If, for instance, in the circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span>
mentioned in the above paragraph the
enemy open fire on you at a long range, you may
presume that he does so in order to keep you at
arm’s length, and if you halt you are probably
doing what he wishes you to do.</p>

<p>7. However small your party may be when
acting independently, it is responsible for its
own protection, and it should always have an
advance guard or its equivalent.</p>

<p>8. Whenever you have an opportunity of doing
so, and the tactical situation allows of it,
check your ranges by firing at an auxiliary
mark where you can see the splash of your bullet,
such as a dusty road or water.</p>

<p>9. When you have ascertained the correct distances
of the object, make a range-card and pass
on your information to neighbouring troops.</p>

<p>10. If you see a good opportunity of inflicting
loss on the enemy, but it is impracticable to
check the range, use combined sights.</p>

<p>11. Remember that if the target you are
shooting at is large enough and you know the
range, you can inflict heavy losses with rifle and
machine-gun fire at ranges well over 2,000 yards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
12. Do not forget to make use of the map
when estimating a range.</p>

<p>13. Although the secret of success in an engagement
is the proper co-operation of the different
arms of the service, the platoon commander
must not cry out for artillery assistance
when he has the means of carrying out his task
in his own platoon, which, with its riflemen, its
Lewis gunners, its bombers, and its rifle bombers,
is, in itself, a miniature division. In an
action where telephonic communication has
broken down this rule applies with special
force.</p>

<p>14. Above all things, impress on your men
the enormous power of their rifle. I have heard
many stories of men not firing at all because they
hoped the enemy would come within <em>bombing
range</em>. I have also heard of bodies of German
troops streaming across the open unfired at because
no order was given. I have also heard of
machine guns stopping a German advance, whilst
infantry who were lying down beside them did
not fire a shot.</p>

<p>15. Rifle grenades and bombs both have their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>
proper uses, and in trench fighting it would be
difficult to get on without them. The former
are also excellent for giving covering fire whilst
a post is being rushed; but if the infantryman’s
worth be 100, of this 100, 85 per cent. belongs to
his rifle and bayonet, 10 per cent. to his rifle
grenade, and 5 per cent. at the outside to his
bomb.</p>

<p>16. Never miss an opportunity to reorganise
your company or platoon, as the case may be,
ready for the next emergency.</p>

<p>17. After capturing a trench or work, get
your Lewis guns into position without any delay.
From a small front they can bring a great
fire to bear, and they must be given the best
position. Under the protection given by them,
the remainder of your command must consolidate.</p>

<p>(For consolidation, see note to Scheme 7.)</p>

<p>18. Your duty towards the enemy is your duty
towards your neighbour reversed. Think how
he could make himself most objectionable to you
and act in this manner towards him.</p>

<p>19. Always be certain that you understand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
your orders, and if you are in doubt never hesitate
to ask and make certain, even should your
commanding officer have a short temper.</p>

<p>20. If you are detached for any specific purpose
you should always rejoin your unit when
you have accomplished what you were told to
do.</p>

<p>21. Do not fail to give negative information.
Young officers are very apt to neglect this. It
may be of great importance to a commanding
officer to know that a certain place is not held
by the enemy, and this is just the kind of information
that his patrol leaders are apt to forget
to send him.</p>

<p>22. Always insist on any verbal order you
may give being repeated to you by the recipient
before he leaves your presence.</p>

<p>23. In a retirement you send men to the rear
with orders to take up another position to protect
your retirement; always see that they are
accompanied by a competent leader, or when the
last party falls back they will very likely find
that their retirement is unsupported.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
Try to remember these axioms. My subsequent
letters will be founded on their application.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">My dear Dick</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>I will now proceed to set you a few problems
in illustration of the axioms which I gave you
at the end of my last letter.</p>

<p>The first will be on the subject of taking a
German pill-box, for I have heard of many instances
of a pill-box holding up the advance of
a whole brigade for a very considerable period.
I have also heard how many gallant but badly
devised attempts to carry it have failed, and the
lives of officers and men have been sacrificed in
vain, and how eventually a better commanded
platoon has succeeded in taking it with very
little loss.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Problem 1</span></h3>

<p><i>W</i>, <i>X</i>, and <i>Y</i> are three pill-boxes about 150
yards apart. We are attacking in the direction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
of the arrows, that is, in a northerly direction.</p>

<p>Our men following close behind the barrage
took pill-boxes <i>W</i> and <i>Y</i>; but, partly owing to
the conformation of the ground and partly for
other reasons, we failed to take <i>X</i>, and this pill-box
is now holding up the whole of our advance
between <i>W</i>, wood, and <i>Y</i>, knoll, with a machine
gun, which is being fired from the inside of the
pill-box, and which sweeps the whole ground
between these points so effectively that directly
we attempt to advance our men are mown down.</p>

<p>It is apparent that <i>X</i> has only one machine
gun in action, though this is a very efficient one.</p>

<p>From the contours on the sketch, it is evident
that the ground is convex in formation, that is,
that it is nearly flat between <i>X</i> and <i>H</i>¹, but that
it slopes rapidly between <i>H</i>¹ and <i>H</i>, between <i>B</i>¹
and <i>B</i>, and between <i>C</i>¹ and <i>C</i>.</p>

<p>The slopes are covered with brushwood. The
ground between contour 120 and the pill-box is
meadow land.</p>

<p>The platoon originally told off to attack <i>X</i>
was wiped out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Problem.</i></h4>

<p>You have been ordered to take <i>X</i> with your
platoon and to do so as quickly as possible.
When you receive these orders you are yourself
at <i>H</i>, and, as you will see from the sketch, are
not under fire from <i>X</i>.</p>

<p>What steps will you take to carry out your
orders?</p>

<p>Do not enter into an elaborate dissertation,
but give short, concise orders, and if you desire
to do so, append a short statement saying why
you gave these orders.</p>

<h4><i>Action considered Correct.</i></h4>

<p>As there is only one machine gun in action, if
<i>X</i> be attacked simultaneously from <i>B</i>¹ and <i>C</i>¹,
either one party or the other should succeed in
getting to the rear of the pill-box and blowing
in the door.</p>

<h4><i>Orders.</i></h4>

<p>No. 4 Section with the Lewis gun will choose
a position somewhere to the north of <i>H</i>, and on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
my signal will open a rapid fire on the loopholes
of the pill-box at <i>X</i>. No. 3 Section will choose a
position near <i>B</i>¹, and when the Lewis gun opens
fire, they will open a rapid rifle-grenade fire on
<i>X</i>. One minute after the Lewis gun has opened,
No. 1 Section will rush in from <i>C</i>¹ and No. 2
Section from <i>B</i>¹.</p>

<p>I am aware that in the foregoing problem I
have made the task of the platoon commander a
very simple one. I wished, however, to avoid
any points of controversy. If the ground should
not be so advantageous for your attack as that
above depicted, the principle, viz. movement combined
with fire, still remains the same. You
should bring a converging attack to bear and
advance your men under cover of the fire of your
rifle grenades and Lewis guns, and by pushing
men forward from one shell-crater to another,
you should generally be able to achieve your
object if your plan be evolved on sound principles.
It is also possible that smoke bombs could
be used with advantage if the wind be favourable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
The above problem is one which has often
been put to young officers on the battlefield, and
they have not by any means always given a satisfactory
answer to it, simple as it is.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">My dear Dick</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>Since the early days of the campaign there
has been but little fighting in towns or villages
which have not previously been so knocked about
that they could better be designated ruins than
habitable places, but in the event of an advance
on a large scale towns and villages are certain
to be the scenes of severe combats. I will therefore
give you three little problems in street-fighting.
When you have read them, the points
I call attention to will probably seem to you so
self-evident that you will wonder that I have
considered it worth while to comment on them.
Nevertheless, I am not quite sure that you will
give what I consider to be the correct answers
to all of them, if you do not turn over the page
and look at the solutions I have given, before
stating your own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Problem 2</span></h3>

<p>The brigade to which you belong has entered
a town from a southerly direction, and you are
opposed by an enemy who has entered it from
a northerly direction.</p>

<p>The company of which you are in command
has been allotted the ground between the roads
<i>B F</i>, <i>C G</i>, both inclusive, your flanks are protected,
the streets are about thirty feet broad
with pavements five feet broad, houses run all
along the streets.</p>

<h4><i>Answer the following Questions.</i></h4>

<p>(<i>a</i>) If you were to tell off a section to prevent
the enemy advancing along the street <i>B F</i>
from a northerly direction, which side of the
street would it be best for them to occupy, and
why?</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Your men occupy the streets <i>B D</i> and
<i>D C</i>, but no man can show his face in the street
<i>A H</i>, which is covered by machine guns and
snipers firing from near <i>A</i>, and all men attempting
to cross the road at <i>D</i> have been shot. Several<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>
houses in the street <i>B D</i> have been knocked
down by shell fire.</p>

<p>In this street there are six empty wagons and
in the houses in the street there is to be found
furniture of all descriptions, as well as ropes,
harness, and stables, with some horses in them.
You are anxious to place a barricade across the
street <i>A H</i> at <i>D</i>, so as to enable you to use the
crossing at <i>D</i>. How should you set about making
this barricade?</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) There is a house at <i>H</i> looking right down
the street <i>A H</i>. Whereabouts in this house
should you put your Lewis gun, and why?</p>

<h4><i>Solutions.</i></h4>

<p>(<i>a</i>) On the western side, because your men,
shooting out of the windows in a northerly
direction, would then fire from their right shoulders
without exposing their bodies.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Fill the wagons with rubble from the
houses which have been knocked down. Fasten
sacking or sheets on to the wagon, so as to give
cover from view between the body of the wagon
and the ground. Throw a string attached to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
a brick across the street. By means of this, pull
over a rope and attach the wagons to this rope,
and thus pull them into the position you require.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) At the back of a room in the house, where
you can see but cannot be seen, firing through
the window. If you choose a window near the
top of the house and put the Lewis gun on a
table some distance back in the room, you will
probably be able to fire over the barricade which
you are thinking of constructing at <i>D</i>.</p>

<p>I have put you three definite and very simple
questions with regard to street-fighting, for it
may often happen that correct action on the
spur of the moment when a village is first entered
may result in ground being easily gained
which would otherwise entail heavy fighting and
serious loss to capture.</p>

<p>Street-fighting is a very big subject, and as
a rule it gradually develops into underground
warfare.</p>

<p>Villages entered during a battle often have
snipers in the top stories or on the roofs of the
houses, and these are places in which you may
also place a few good shots with great advantage.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span>
This is an illustration of the advisability of doing
to the enemy what you do not like his doing to
you.</p>

<p>I will send you another problem next week.</p>

<p class="sigright"><i>December 22, 1917.</i></p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">My dear Dick</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>You have told me that you have once or twice
temporarily commanded a company and have
asked me whether I think there is any advantage
in a young and active company commander
being mounted.</p>

<p>In another part of your letter you ask whether
I think a defensive position should be taken up
on a forward or on a reverse slope.</p>

<p>This latter is a very big question and one on
which many pages could be written, but I shall
confine myself here to saying that it is imperative
to hold the crest line in order to get observation,
but that, owing to the crest line and
forward slope being so much more vulnerable
by artillery fire than is the reverse slope, there
are many advantages in constructing the main
line of defence well behind the crest.</p>

<p>I find now that I have tried in a few words<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
to answer your second question before dealing
with the first one. The object of giving you a
horse is, firstly, to enable you to move about
more rapidly, and consequently to do your duty
better; and secondly, because a company commander’s
work really begins when the march
is over. It is infinitely more important that
he should be fresh than that any other man in
the company should be so. Again, by riding on
in front and making proper arrangements for
bivouacs or billets, he may save weary men much
marching and counter-marching, and, what is
even more important, he will on other occasions,
by being able to push on in front, save half an
hour by thinking out proper tactical dispositions
before his men arrive. I will now give you a
little problem which will, I think, illustrate the
two questions which you have asked me. You
must, nevertheless, remember that there can be
no hard-and-fast rule as to where a position
should be taken up. We cannot alter the ground
to suit our formation, and therefore our formations
must be made to suit the ground. The
proper way to hold ground when the object is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
to fight a rearguard action is quite different
from the way it should be held to fight a battle
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à l’outrance</i>, and all I will commit myself to
doing is to give my advice as to how a certain
piece of ground should be held in certain given
circumstances. I hope that the following problem
will, to a certain extent, answer both your
questions.</p>

<h3 id="Problem_3"><span class="smcap">Problem 3</span></h3>

<p>An advance guard, of which the company you
command forms part, has been pushed forward
to seize a position of which the ridge <i>B-I</i> forms
a part. The main body should reach the position
some eight hours after your arrival there.
You have been told that your first object is to
prevent the enemy’s cavalry seizing the position.
The enemy’s cavalry, accompanied by horse artillery,
may be expected in the proximity of the
position within an hour or so after your arrival,
but it is unlikely that his infantry and field
artillery will arrive much before your own main
body. The time of the year is July, the hour is
4 p.m. The soil is sandy, but covered with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
grass. You are riding at the head of your company,
and are about two miles from the crest
when a staff officer accompanied by the adjutant
rides up to you and you receive the following
instructions:</p>

<p>“Our cavalry have reached the crest of the
ridge <i>B C D E F G H I</i> without encountering
opposition. You will be responsible for the front
from <i>E</i> to <i>I</i>, both inclusive, until the main body
arrives, and must make immediate arrangements
for securing it against attack by hostile cavalry
and horse artillery. Not a minute is to be lost.
You will also do your best to prepare the front
allotted to you for defence against a strong infantry
attack which the enemy will probably
deliver, though it is unlikely that he will be in
a position to do so before dawn to-morrow.”</p>

<h4><i>Question 1.</i></h4>

<p>What would you do on receipt of these orders?</p>

<h4><i>Action considered Correct.</i></h4>

<p>You should save time by handing over command
of your company and yourself cantering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
on so as to examine the ground and carefully
consider your plans before your company arrives.
The line of argument you should adopt
on arrival on the ridge should be: “My first object
is to prevent cavalry, assisted by horse
artillery, reaching the ridge, and not a single
moment is to be lost in doing this.</p>

<p>“My second object is to consider carefully
how the ground can best be prepared to resist
a determined infantry attack early to-morrow
morning. It is possible that the ridge may be
subjected to shell fire soon after the arrival of
my company, and I must make hay whilst the
sun shines.”</p>

<p>The conclusions you would come to as a result
of this reasoning would probably be: “It is improbable
that I shall be able to entrench the
whole of my company before the enemy opens
fire, but at all events I will try to make emplacements
for my four Lewis guns on the ridge between
<i>E</i> and <i>I</i>. They will thus be about eighty
yards apart.</p>

<p>“I will use intensive labour to get these emplacements
completed quickly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
By intensive labour is meant telling off three
men to each tool used and ordering the man to
dig with all his might and main for a couple of
minutes or until he is tired, and then to hand
his tool over to another man who is ready to
receive it. By this means more work can be
done in half an hour than is usually done in an
hour. For periods of under an hour, when men
are working against time to achieve some important
object, intensive labour is an excellent
method to adopt, but it is not suited for long
tasks where its use would wear men out. It is
especially applicable where the task worked at
is so small that only a very limited number of
men can work simultaneously.</p>

<p>“I will, at the same time, construct trenches
connecting these Lewis gun posts. It is possible
that the arrival of the enemy’s guns will oblige
me to relinquish work until the night, but the
fact that the trenches have been commenced in
the daytime will very much assist the men in
their night work. I will afterwards construct
supporting points at the farm <i>L</i> and between <i>M</i>
and <i>N</i> on the reverse slope.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Question 2.</i></h4>

<p>If you concur with these conclusions, what
principle will govern your action in putting the
farm into a state of defence? You will notice
that the farm shows a bigger front to the east and
the west than it does to the north and the south.
It is constructed of strong masonry and has two
stories.</p>

<h4><i>Action which is considered Correct.</i></h4>

<p>You should use the southern rooms in the
farm for your machine guns rather than the
northern ones, as you will there be more protected
from shell fire. You must keep your
defence as much below ground as possible, using
cellars if they are available, and otherwise digging
trenches inside the walls so as to have your
loopholes a few inches above the ground level.</p>

<p>Construct head cover with strong baulks close
over your heads, so that in the event of the whole
building being brought down, it will not affect
you, but only give you more cover from high-angle
fire. If possible put wire round the<span class="pagenum"><a class="hidev" id="Page_38">38</a><a  id="Page_39">39</a></span>
northern end of the building. Arrange to flank
the work between <i>M N</i>, which should in turn
protect your front.</p>

<div id="ip_39" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i038.jpg" width="600" height="440" alt="" />
  <div class="captionl"><p class="in0 narrow"><i>Work for 40 men &amp; 2 m. gs. or Lewis guns.
It only requires 40 to hold it, but would
give cover to twice as many</i></p>

<p class="right"><i>Angles at B &amp; C arbitrary
to suit ground.</i></p></div></div>

<h4><i>Question 3.</i></h4>

<p>What description of work will you make between
<i>M</i> and <i>N</i>?</p>

<h4><i>Action considered Correct.</i></h4>

<p>The best form of work to construct will be
one made on the principle of that shown in the
annexed diagram. As will be seen, this consists
of a series of island traverses strung together
more or less in the shape of an “S.” The advantage
of this is not only that it is suitable for
all-round defence, but that the whole of the
garrison can fire simultaneously in almost any
direction, the weakest points being <i>A</i> and <i>D</i>.
The work shown in the diagram would require
a garrison of about forty men, but it could give
cover to eighty. It is less vulnerable by artillery
fire than almost any other form of work.
It is an easy work to construct in so far that a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
large number of men can work at it at the same
time without interfering with each other. The
acuteness or obtuseness of the angles at <i>B</i> and
<i>C</i> must depend entirely upon the ground, but it
stands to reason that the more the angles approach
right angles, the more is the work suitable
for all-round defence.</p>

<p>The “crucifix” strong point is also a good
pattern, but I think that the one that I have
given you is better, as it is in every way a less
satisfactory mark for the enemy artillery, and
also gives you quite as good, if not better, opportunity
of using all your rifles in every direction.</p>

rearguard commander.</p>

<p class="sigright"><i>January 1, 1918.</i></p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">My dear Dick</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>The last scheme I gave you dealt with the
taking up of a position when an attack by a weak
force was probable within an hour or so of your
occupying it, and also with the strengthening of
the same position for an expected attack by a
stronger force twelve hours later. This one
deals with a rearguard action. It is straightforward
and plain. The object that troops fighting
a rearguard action should have in mind is
to keep the enemy at arm’s length, to punish
him severely if he is too bold, and at the same
time not to compromise their own retreat, unless
duty requires them to sacrifice themselves in
order to save the main body. I will now set you
the problem before I make my own solution too
evident by my remarks. It is my intention to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>
add a few more words at the end of this letter,
but I do not wish you to look at them until you
have written your own solution.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Problem 4</span></h3>

<p>The banks of the River Lea are steep, the
river is about four feet six inches deep, except
near the ford. The bottom is muddy. At the
ford it is forty yards broad, in most other places
about twenty yards. The fields on either side
are firm. The roads shown on the sketch are
dry and dusty. The soil is chalky. The depth
of the river at the ford is two feet six inches.
The date is June 20.</p>

<p>One of the orderlies attached to you reports
that at Slag Farm there is a large quantity of
wire, some of it barbed.</p>

<p>The brigade to which you belong is retiring
in a southerly direction. The baggage moved
in front of the brigade. The time is 5.30 p.m.
You with your company, to which six mounted
orderlies have been attached, are near Home
Farm, the remainder of your battalion, which is
in rear of the brigade, is passing through Silverton,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
when the adjutant rides up to you and gives
you the following order:</p>

<p>“Information has been received that a hostile
cavalry brigade is pursuing. You will take such
steps as you may consider necessary to prevent
the enemy crossing the River Lea between Stone
Bridge and Slag Farm, both inclusive, until 7
p.m., at which hour you will be relieved by cavalry.
You will be careful not to compromise
your own retreat. Having accomplished your
task, you will rejoin your unit.”</p>

<h4><i>Problem.</i></h4>

<p>How do you appreciate the situation, and
what steps will you take to carry out your instructions?</p>

<h4><i>Solution considered Correct.</i></h4>

<p>The River Lea is in all places within 800 yards
of the ridge, and as the conditions are particularly
favourable for fire action from the ridge,
there is no necessity for you to place your men
down the forward slope. The circumstances
which render the situation so favourable for fire
action are that it is practically impossible for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
the enemy’s cavalry to cross the River Lea, except
at the bridge or at the ford. The bridge
and the road, with ponds on either side of it,
just to the north of the bridge, form a defile 150
yards long, through which the enemy must pass.
The ponds and the river also afford you an excellent
opportunity to check the range by the splash
of your bullets.</p>

<p>By filling the ford with wire you should also
succeed in making that very difficult to cross.
The great objection to putting men on the forward
slope is that they will come under severe
fire from the horse artillery which will accompany
the cavalry, and that under cover of this
fire the cavalry are much more likely to be able
to cross than they would be if fired at from a
concealed position on the ridge. Besides which
all movement by men on the forward slope would
be seen and the men themselves would not be able
to retire until dark.</p>

<h4><i>Orders.</i></h4>

<p>1. Nos. 3 and 4 Platoons will proceed under
Lieutenant Smith to the neighbourhood of Cross<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
Farm, where they will take up the best positions
they can find with the object of protecting the
crossing of the River Lea.</p>

<p>It has been reported that a large quantity of
wire, some of it barbed, is to be found at Slag
Farm. Lieutenant Smith will take steps to obstruct
the ford with this with the object of
denying its use to the enemy.</p>

<p>2. No. 1 Platoon will take up a position near
Home Farm and No. 2 Platoon near Hope Farm,
also with the object of preventing the crossing
of the River Lea.</p>

<p>3. No. 2 Platoon from Hope Farm will fire
ranging shots on to the ford at Slag Farm, Chalk
Pit, and the two road junctions to the north of
the ford, and when the officer commanding the
platoon is certain by the observation of his fire
that he has obtained the correct ranges, he will
pass this information to the officer commanding
No. 1 Platoon.</p>

<p>The officer commanding No. 1 Platoon will
range on the ponds near the bridge and on the
road junction to the north of them, and will
similarly pass the range chart to the officer commanding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
No. 2 Platoon. This ranging will be
carried out at once in order that the ranging
by Nos. 1 and 2 Platoons may be finished before
the ranging is commenced by the officers commanding
Nos. 3 and 4 Platoons, which will be
carried out under the orders of Lieutenant
Smith.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;I am quite aware that a company is
supposed to carry a Barr &amp; Stroud range-finder.
Although this is an excellent instrument when
it is in thorough order, there is really no such
reliable range-finder as a rifle fired at a mark
which will show the impact of the bullet.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>In the proper solution of the foregoing scheme,
everything really depends upon your fire orders.
I am presuming that your men are fairly well
trained with the rifle. I wish, of course, that all
our men were trained up to the standard of the
Old Contemptibles, but “Rome was not built in
a day,” nor can discipline and good marksmanship
become part of a man’s second nature as a
result of only a few months’ training. If, however,
your men are reasonably good shots and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
can fire at least fifteen rounds a minute (they
ought to fire twenty under peace conditions),
in such cases as the above much more will depend
upon whether you give correct fire orders than
upon whether the men are first-class marksmen
or only moderately good shots. You can compare
a company of first-class marksmen to a
Choke-bore gun which shoots farther and harder
but requires a skilled game shot to use with
advantage, whereas a company of moderately-trained
shots would resemble an ordinary scatter
gun, with which the ordinary shot would
probably do more execution. If you give a range
as 1,200 yards when it is only 1,000 yards and
you have marksmen, no shots will fall on the
object; whereas if your company were composed
of third-class shots, the chances are that it would
be well sprinkled with bullets. Do not think
from this that I prefer the third-class shots, for
that is very decidedly not the case; but if you
have a highly finished weapon, you want a good
man behind it, although in the hands of such a
one it will do brilliant execution. If you have a
company of good shots and are not certain of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
range, your best plan is to fire with combined
sights and thus to increase the depth of the fire-swept
ground. This method, although in many
cases the best to adopt, is bound to diminish the
efficacy of your fire, for if the correct range be
1,200 yards and you fire one platoon at 1,000
yards, one at 1,100, one at 1,200, and one at
1,300, it stands to reason that you can only hope
to get a quarter as many hits as you would do
if you gave the whole four platoons the correct
range; but even that is better than giving the
range at 1,000 and missing the mark altogether.
It is a bad plan to go “Nap” before you have
looked at your hand. I shall later on give you
certain little problems for solution in which I
am of opinion that combined sights should be
used. In the problem under consideration, however,
their use would be absolutely wrong. You
can check all the ranges by seeing the splash of
the bullets either in the ponds, in the river, or on
the Chalk Pit, and you should be content with
nothing except the correct range. Young officers
are always apt to consider that so long as they
have taught their company to shoot fairly well,
they have done their duty with regard to musketry.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>
This is, in reality, by no means the case.
The company is simply the sportsman’s gun;
the commander has to learn how to use it.</p>

<p>There are many circumstances under which a
man has to pick out his own target, as, for instance,
when the enemy is attacking, and here
everything depends upon his individual marksmanship.
There are, however, many other occasions
in which if 10 per cent. of the effect depends
upon whether the men are first-class
marksmen or only ordinary decent shots, 90 per
cent. will depend upon whether the officer gives
fire orders properly adapted to the situation.
The above problem is an illustration of this principle.</p>

<p>You should notice that in my solution I carefully
arranged that the party comprised of Nos.
2 and 3 Platoons should not commence ranging
until Nos. 1 and 2 Platoons had finished. Were
they to fire simultaneously, confusion in the
splashes made by the bullets would be the result.</p>

<p>Don’t forget to hand over your range card to
your relief.</p>

<h3 id="Problem_5a"><span class="smcap">Problem 5</span><i>a</i></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">My dear Dick</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>I will set you another problem.</p>

<p>The force to which you belong has made a
night march. Your platoon now forms part of
a new outpost line. You halted in a ditch at
line marked <i>D</i>, with a thin hedge on the enemy’s
side of it, which gives you good cover from view.
Your idea was to use this place as the headquarters
of your picket, and as soon as it was
thoroughly light to throw groups out in front.
Your platoon consists of forty men and a Lewis
gun. Soon after dawn and when your men are
still in the trench at <i>D</i>, you see what you take
to be a strong platoon of the enemy advancing
straight towards you from the north; a couple
of groups of men are fifty yards in front, and
the remainder of the platoon is advancing in
fours along a country road, which passes close<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
to your position. You see the platoon when it is
at <i>A</i> about 1,000 yards off.</p>

<p>What action will you take?</p>

<h4><i>Action considered Correct.</i></h4>

<p>There seems to be every chance of your being
able to ambuscade this party, and you should
let it advance until the groups which the main
body has in front of it are within fifty yards of
your picquet. You should tell off a few men on
the flanks to deal with these groups, and turn
the fire of the whole of the rest of your platoon
on to the main body. You must be careful to see
that all your men lie down, that no one but
yourself has his head above ground level, and
you must camouflage yourself. The suspense in
such a situation as this makes great demands on
the men’s discipline, and they are apt to look up
and be seen by the enemy, thus destroying all
hope of surprise.</p>

<h3 id="Problem_5b"><span class="smcap">Problem 5</span><i>b</i></h3>

<p>The situation is exactly the same as in <a href="#Problem_5a">Problem
5<i>a</i></a>, except that instead of a platoon advancing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
towards you, there is a whole company
marching in fours, with four groups 100 yards
in front of it.</p>

<p>What action would you take?</p>

<h4><i>Action considered Correct.</i></h4>

<p>Exactly the same as in Problem 5<i>a</i>. The
enemy is in this case four times as strong as you
are, but the effect of surprise should more than
make up for this, and the first minute after you
open fire should decide the action in your favour.</p>

<h3 id="Problem_5c"><span class="smcap">Problem 5</span><i>c</i></h3>

<p>The situation is again exactly the same as in
<a href="#Problem_5a">5<i>a</i></a> and <a href="#Problem_5b">5<i>b</i></a>, except that a whole battalion with
eight groups 200 yards in front of it is advancing.</p>

<p>What action would you take?</p>

<h4><i>Action considered Correct.</i></h4>

<p>In this case the situation is changed. You
are an outpost, and your first duty is to warn
your main body in case of an attack and to give
it time to prepare itself. It is just possible that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
if you allow the battalion to approach to within
300 yards you might deal it such a blow as to
almost destroy it; but if, on the contrary, the
covering groups were composed of really good
soldiers and the companies were well commanded,
there would be a great chance of your being
rushed, and this is a risk which you ought not
to take, for it would compromise the whole situation.
In these circumstances you should therefore
take steps to open a rapid fire on the enemy
immediately with your men and your Lewis gun.
Your object in doing this would be to keep him
at arm’s length and delay his advance as much
as possible so as to give your supports and reserves
time to prepare themselves.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Problem 6</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">My dear Dick</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>In this letter I am going to set you another
fire problem. It is one in which, presuming
that the men are fairly well trained in musketry,
everything depends on the orders given
by the company commander.</p>

<p>You are in command of a company and are
marching in a northerly direction along the road
<i>W B E</i>, with scouts in front of you. On reaching
the top of the ridge at <i>B</i> your scouts halt
and beckon to you. You go forward and see
what appears to be an enemy’s battalion at <i>X</i>,
by the bank of the River Spate. The battalion
is in close column and the men are lying down
resting. The country all round the battalion
is open. There is a thin hedge on the top of
the ridge <i>A B C</i> through which you can see and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>
through which you could fire, but which gives
you cover from view.</p>

<p>State how the situation presents itself to you
and also give your exact orders.</p>

<h4><i>Solution considered Correct.</i></h4>

<p>You should reason with yourself as follows:</p>

<p>“If I advance beyond the hedge I shall be
seen and my company will be opposed by a battalion.
There seems to be an excellent opportunity
of surprising the enemy, who shows no
sign of moving, with my concentrated fire, and
I shall consequently make my plans deliberately.
From my map I judge the distance from the
top of the ridge to the bridge over the River
Spate to be 1,300 yards, and the centre of the
battalion about 1,400 yards, but as I want to
be quite sure of getting the battalion into
my bracket, I shall use combined sights.
I shall first line up the whole company 30
yards behind the hedge, and then order No. 1
Platoon to fix their sights at 1,300, No. 2 at 1,400,
No. 3 at 1,500, and No. 4 at 1,600 yards, with the
Lewis gun of No. 1 Platoon at 1,350, that of No.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
2 at 1,400, that of No. 3 at 1,450, and that of No.
4 at 1,500 yards. I shall then order the whole
company to creep up into position, and when the
target has been properly pointed out I shall
blow my whistle, on which every man will fire
twenty rounds rapid and each Lewis gun six
drums. At the end of the twenty rounds I can,
if necessary, correct my ranges. Men are, as a
rule, more apt to fire high than low, and I should
have given the ranges 1,200, 1,300, 1,400, 1,500,
instead of 1,300, 1,400, 1,500, 1,600, had it not
been that the river will prevent the enemy rushing
straight towards me if he finds the fire is
high, whereas if my ranges are short he could get
out of range by retiring.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Problem 7</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">My dear Dick</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>The following is a problem in trench warfare
such as you may be called upon to solve any day
in the trenches.</p>

<p>The company of which you are in command
has succeeded in getting into a trench a section
of which is given in the diagram. It has only
incurred about 10 per cent. of casualties. The
trench is the last of the German system, and
there is a clear field of fire for about 100 yards
in the direction in which the enemy has retired;
after that there is a thick wood.</p>

<p>Your telephone communication has broken
down and it is evident that you will for some
time have to rely on your own resources. Your
flanks are secured by troops on your right and
left. Your company now numbers 120 rank and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>
file. The front allotted to you measures about
150 yards. The trench which you are now occupying
was considerably shelled by us previous
to its capture, and what was the rear of the
trench when the Germans held it, namely <i>H G F</i>,
has been considerably broken down in half a
dozen places. It is quite possible that the Germans
will counter-attack from the wood without
delay. It is evident from the section of the
trench depicted on the diagram that you cannot
fire out of it as it is at present.</p>

<h4><i>Problem.</i></h4>

<p>What action will you take to prepare for the
enemy’s counter-attack?</p>

<h4><i>Solution considered Correct.</i></h4>

<p>Your position is a difficult one, for there is
no place from which your men can fire. You
cannot even use the step <i>C</i>, nor the parapet <i>A K</i>,
for the parados <i>H G</i> is, as is usually the case,
eighteen inches higher than is the old crest line
at <i>A</i>. In the short time at your disposal it will
be next to impossible to make a continuous step<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a></span>
so as to enable you to fire over <i>H</i>, and in the circumstances
the best thing for you to do is to concentrate
the whole of your energies on getting
your Lewis guns into position and to use intensive
labour for the purpose.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> It is possible that
you may be able to get one or two of the Lewis
guns satisfactorily into position at some of the
places in which the revetment in <i>F G H</i> has been
knocked down. If, in your company, you have
half a dozen iron or wire grips which you can
utilise to pull down the sandbag revetment, you
will find them of the greatest assistance, for men
who only have their hands to work with find it
very difficult to get a grip on a sandbag which
is in a revetment.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> See <a href="#Problem_3">Problem 3</a>, p. 35.</p></div>

<p>You must at once place look-out men to give
you warning of any sign of the enemy assembling
in the edge of the wood to your front and be
prepared to open on them with rifle grenades.</p>

<p>The real advantage that a machine gun or
Lewis gun has over a rifle is that from a small
point of vantage one of these weapons can pour
a tremendous hail of fire, and in such circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
as those depicted above there is no doubt
but that the first consideration should be to get
your Lewis guns into position.</p>

<p>If possible, it is best to place these in pairs,
shooting obliquely and crossing their fire in front
of you. As soon as this is done you should thin
out and organise your defence in depth. This
being carried out, you must determine what localities
you will hold and where you will have
your gaps. You should generally have a locality
in front of any communication trench leading
up from the rear. As soon as you have determined
on your localities, you must set-to and
build a fire step. The next measure to take in
order of importance is to collect ammunition and
place it at convenient points. After you have
done this, try to put wire or some other obstacle
in front. In advising this, I am presuming that
you have reached your final objective. Be careful
to remove any old German wire behind you
which will prevent your own supports coming up
over the open to reinforce you. Try to get your
localities marked by lamps at night, that your
own friends in rear can see where they are.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Problem 8</span></h3>

<p>After hard fighting you have driven the enemy
out of the trench <i>A B C</i>, and he has retired up
the communication trench <i>D E F</i> in the direction
of his supports. You are in command of a
platoon and have been ordered to take steps to
prevent the enemy again advancing along the
communication trench <i>E D B</i>. It is not the intention
of your commanding officer to advance at
present any farther than the points he has already
reached. The time is an hour before dark.</p>

<p>What steps will you take to carry out the instructions
you have received?</p>

<h4><i>Solution considered Correct.</i></h4>

<p>Pull knife-rests<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> down into the trench <i>D E F</i>,
also throw wire into it if available. At once put
a couple of men at the point <i>D</i> to cover the
trench <i>D E</i> with their rifles. As soon as you are
able to do so, dig a short trench from <i>G</i> to <i>D</i> and
place a Lewis gun at <i>G</i> to enfilade <i>D E</i>. You
may have to wait until after dark before you
<span class="pagenum"><a class="hidev" id="Page_68">68</a><a  id="Page_69">69</a></span>actually carry this out, but you should make
arrangements for doing it by daylight. It would
not be a bad plan to tie a few tins on to the knife-rests
which you have thrown into the trench, so
that the rattle, if they are moved, will give you
warning of any one’s approach. The Lewis gun
at <i>G</i> will be practically out of bombing range
from <i>E F</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> A knife-rest is a portable wire entanglement about 10 feet
long, made upon a wooden frame-work.</p></div>

<p>There are as many different types of stops as
there are different sorts of trenches. Some of
these types are better than others, but there is
no type which is suitable under all circumstances.
Everything must depend on the exact
local conditions and on the means at your disposal.
It does not require much ingenuity to
devise a good stop for a trench if you have
leisure to think the matter out, but just as a
remark which would be commonplace if given as
the result of matured deliberation is regarded
as brilliant if made as a quick repartee, so in
tactics to do what is right under fire is quite
a different thing to answering a question on an
examination paper. Nevertheless, to have answered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
a similar question on an examination
paper, or, still better, to have done it as a tactical
exercise, renders it very much more likely
that you will do the right thing when you are
faced by a similar problem in earnest. I, therefore,
counsel you to carefully consider the different
sorts of trenches which you come across
and to think out carefully how you would put a
stop in them, or how you turn them to shoot in
the opposite direction. In the diagram I have
given you it is just possible that by cutting down
the elbow at <i>E</i>, you may be able to enfilade the
section of trench <i>E F</i> from <i>A</i>. This would, however,
depend on the ground and on the actual
construction of the trenches concerned.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Problem 9</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">My dear Dick</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>This week my letter will be a short one, as it
only contains one very simple problem.</p>

<p>You are on outpost duty and have been told
that the General is very anxious to get one or
two live prisoners. Your picquet is at some
cross-roads a quarter of a mile south of the
road <i>A B</i> marked on the map. You have reason
to believe that it is probable that the enemy
will patrol down the road <i>A B</i>. <i>A B</i> is a good
road with strong fences on either side of it, and
with ditches on the road side of the fence.</p>

<p>Does any special way of taking prisoners alive
in this road suggest itself to you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Solution.</i></h4>

<p>A very good plan to adopt in these circumstances
would be what the Japanese used to call
the trap-door. If your post consists of six men,
leave four under the leader at <i>A</i> and tell them to
conceal themselves in the ditch, and place two,
also concealed in the ditch, forty yards in front
of the mat <i>B</i>. If the enemy’s patrol comes along,
the men at <i>B</i> should allow it to pass them and
then give a signal and at the same time themselves
take steps to cut off the patrol’s retreat,
whilst the four men at <i>A</i> prevent it advancing
farther.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The above little scheme is so simple that I
should feel that I ought to apologise for setting
it, were it not that I am quite certain that three
out of four of your comrades to whom you may
set it will not give the proper solution.</p>

<p>I saw a similar little problem given to men
of different regiments in India. The only troops
who answered it properly were Pathans. It apparently
much resembles traps which they set
for one another in their inter-tribal fights. Although<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>
some twenty teams competed, neither
British troops, Sikhs, Hindustani, Mohammedans,
nor Rajputs ever managed to successfully
catch their men.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Problem 10</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">My dear Dick</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>The problem I am setting you to-day has to
do with fire control.</p>

<p>You are on outpost facing in a northerly direction
and are in command of a picquet consisting
of the headquarters of a platoon with a Lewis
gun and thirty men at <i>G</i>. A man who has
been sent in from a group on your left tells
you that a company of the enemy is moving
across your front from left to right along the
road <i>A B C D E F</i>. He says that the company
is marching with an advanced guard of one
platoon about 200 yards in front of it. The
platoon has a couple of groups 200 yards in front
of it again. Five minutes after you have received
this notice, you see a group of the enemy
marching from the wood at <i>B</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Problem.</i></h4>

<p>How do you appreciate the situation and what
action do you intend to take?</p>

<h4><i>Solution.</i></h4>

<p>So long as you remain carefully concealed at
<i>G</i> and your men do not show themselves, it is at
least as likely as not that the enemy’s scouts will
not discover you. If, however, they should do so,
your danger will come from the enemy’s company
and the platoon in front of it and not from
the scouts, and it is with these larger bodies that
you must make your plans to deal. At this close
range you ought to be able to put them out of
action in the first minute after opening fire. If
your men conceal themselves properly, even if
the scouts do discover you, they will not do so
until the enemy’s main body is nearing the point
<i>C</i>. Your orders should consequently be somewhat
as follows:</p>

<p>“Let every man conceal himself.</p>

<p>“The Lewis gun and Nos. 1 and 2 Sections
of the platoon on my command to open fire will
direct their fire half left on the main body of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>
the enemy’s company, which will be the rearmost
party. No. 3 Section will deal with the platoon
forming the advanced guard, and No. 4 Section,
taking its orders from the section commander,
will deal with isolated groups. No man will put
up his head until I give the order to fire. The
whole platoon will use fixed sights.”</p>

<p>You should at once issue these preliminary
orders. If you are not discovered, do not open
fire until the head of the main body has
reached <i>D</i>.</p>

<p>Napoleon used to say that if you ever saw your
enemy making a mistake, you should give him
lots of time to make it thoroughly before punishing
him. Do not pull the bait out of the pike’s
mouth until he has properly gorged it. This
maxim applies equally whether you are dealing
with armies or only with platoons. I, myself,
remember in my early days missing a tiger sixty
yards off, when, if I had only waited, he would
have walked right under the tree on which I was
seated.</p>

<p>I hope you will master and remember the principles
which govern the problem I am setting
you to-day. Although very simple, it requires
a little more thought than most of those which
have preceded it.</p>

<p>The Germans have broken through our front
line. Your company, with its four Lewis guns
and with four Vickers guns which have been
placed under your command, has been hastily
thrown into the trench <i>B</i>, which is well constructed
and well concealed, and has a good field
of fire to the east. Four 18-pounder guns were
in action at a hundred yards north of the trench
<i>B</i>, but two of these guns have already been put
out of action by the enemy’s artillery. The Germans

of sacrifice and are now about a mile distant.
Their object is evidently to take the ridge <i>A C</i>,
and it is of the utmost importance that they
should be frustrated in their endeavours. The
front allotted to you to defend runs from <i>Z</i>
Clump on the north to <i>U</i> Farm on the south.
Other troops are responsible outside these limits.
You have in the trench <i>B</i> 50,000 rounds of ammunition
besides that which the men have on
them. You are senior to the officer in command
of the remaining two 18-pounders.</p>

<p>What action would you take? and give your
reasons.</p>

<h4><i>Comments on the Situation and Action adjudged
Correct.</i></h4>

<p>Let us first of all consider how many rounds
a minute you could expect the troops under
your command to fire in the following circumstances:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) If the fire were only to be continued for
two minutes.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) If it were to be kept up for half an hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span></p>

<table id="ammunition" summary="Ammunition usage">
  <tr>
    <td> </td>
    <td class="tdr">Rounds.</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">(<i>a</i>) If it were to be kept up for two minutes only, you might expect 100 infantrymen to fire from fifteen to twenty rounds a minute (let us say)</td>
    <td class="tdr">3,200</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">Four Lewis guns to fire 600 rounds each in the two minutes</td>
    <td class="tdr">2,400</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">Four Vickers to fire 750 rounds each in two minutes</td>
    <td class="tdr">3,000</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td> </td>
    <td class="tdr"><span class="bt">8,600</span></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">(<i>b</i>) If the fire were to be kept up for half an hour you might justly expect infantry to fire at an average rate of five rounds a minute</td>
    <td class="tdr">15,000</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl nohang">It would be unwise to attempt to exceed this average rate of fire, for even if your men were muscularly able to continue firing at a greater rate, it is a known thing that the nervous strain of firing is such that there are but few men who can fire 200 rounds consecutively without breaking down, and it is of paramount importance that you should keep a certain amount of reserve force in hand in case the enemy gets to a really close range.</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">Four Lewis guns would during the half-hour be able to fire 600 rounds each, and if these rounds were fired at fairly long ranges would still be in a position to fire 600 rounds rapid when the enemy got to close quarters. The platoon commanders would, however, be well advised to regard these Lewis guns as their reserves and to do nothing to risk their being ready to fire 600 rounds at the critical moment. They should, therefore, use them very sparingly at medium ranges</td>
    <td class="tdr">2,400</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">Four Vickers Maxims should be able to fire at an average rate of 200 rounds a minute</td>
    <td class="tdr">24,000</td></tr>
</table>

<p>In other words, in the two minutes you could
fire at the average rate of over 4,000 rounds a
minute, but for half an hour could only keep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>
up an average rate of about 800 rounds a minute.
Another thing to be considered is that your
average of hits at the closer ranges would be
greater than they would be at the farther ranges.
There is, however, no reason why you should not
inflict as much loss as possible on the enemy at
medium and long ranges, provided you know at
what distance to fire. We used to consider in
South Africa that when we were advancing
against a position held by the enemy, he used
to shoot straighter at 500 yards than he did at
200, for, fine shots as the Boers were, their excitement
at our near approach disturbed their
accurate shooting. You may therefore expect
that your men will shoot <em>comparatively</em> better
when the enemy is at medium ranges than when
he is very close, provided that they know the
distance.</p>

<p>It cannot be expected that you will go in for
such a long disquisition at a moment when you
are called upon to act, but you should have considered
these points beforehand, at all events to
such an extent that you would have decided to
open fire when the enemy was still at comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
long ranges, but to increase this fire as
he got closer and to reserve the maximum rate
of fire until you can pour it in with deadly effect.
You must always remember that you are dealing
with human beings who have nerves and not
with machines. As I have previously said, the
above principles should be those on which you
decide to act, but the first thing you should do
would be to send to the officer commanding the
section of guns and inquire from him the ranges
of any objects within rifle shot which he has
ascertained, and you should at the same time
desire him to obtain for you the ranges of any
other prominent objects near which the enemy
must pass, so that if his remaining guns are
knocked out you will know what sights to use.
Whilst this is being done, you should divide
your front between your platoon commanders.
The Lewis guns should remain with their platoons,
but you would be wise to keep the Vickers
Maxims under your own special command, so
that you can turn them on to any portion of the
advancing line which seems especially to threaten
you. In fact, you should look on these as your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
reserve. Having thus considered the situation,
you should issue the following orders:</p>

<p>“Fire fronts are allotted as under:</p>

<div class="in1">
<p>No. 1 Platoon to the right of Farm <i>U</i>.</p>

<p>No. 2 Platoon from farm <i>U</i> to <i>Y</i> tree.</p>

<p>No. 3 Platoon from <i>Y</i> tree to farm <i>W</i>.</p>

<p>No. 4 Platoon to the left of farm <i>W</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p><i>Order</i> No. 2.&mdash;“Ranges are being ascertained
from the artillery and will be passed to platoon
commanders. Platoon commanders can open fire
at their own discretion, but must bear in mind
the enormous importance of being ready in all
respects to use the full power of their fire should
the enemy succeed in getting to close ranges. The
four Vickers Maxim guns will, under my orders,
fire at any portion of the enemy’s advance which
appears to be especially threatening.”</p>

<p>The majority of regimental officers now serving
do not at all appreciate the enormous effect
of rifle and machine-gun fire at medium and long
ranges, nor the importance of taking every step
in their power to obtain the accurate ranges as
soon as they have taken up a position. The
effect of the fire of a fairly good company in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
such circumstances as those above depicted and
acting on the above carefully considered fire
orders would be enormous, whereas if the fire
fronts were not properly allotted and if ranges
were unknown, it would be of comparatively
little value.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">My dear Dick</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>What would you do in the following circumstances?</p>

<p>A force is retiring in a north-westerly direction.
The River Lea shown on the map is unfordable.
Two companies are acting as the
point of the rearguard. Their orders are to hold
the bridges at <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>. The bridge at <i>B</i> is to
be held until 10 a.m. and the bridge at <i>A</i> until
10.30 a.m. If they can hold out until these hours,
it is estimated that it will enable the main body
to get away unmolested. The trees shown on
the map are mostly oak, and are on an average
forty feet high. The roads marked on the map
are metalled and good. The farm buildings at <i>D</i>
are strong. You are commanding B Company
of your battalion, which is at <i>B</i> bridge, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
are senior to Captain A., a reliable officer, who
is occupying <i>A</i> trench just south of <i>A</i> wood. At
9.15 a.m. two scouts mounted on motor bicycles
inform you that they have patrolled to the front
and that none of the enemy are within three
miles of you except a few companies near <i>E</i>,
who are acting as support to an attack which is
being made against <i>A</i> bridge. At 9.20 a.m. you
receive the following message from Captain A.,
dated 9 a.m.: “Please do whatever you can to
support me. I am being heavily shelled, and
infantry are trying to push across <i>A</i> bridge. I
fear that there is no chance of my being able to
hold out until 10.30 a.m.”</p>

<p>What action would you take? State your
reasons for the manner in which you would act
and then definitely say what you intend to do.</p>

<h4><i>Comments on the Situation and Action adjudged
Correct.</i></h4>

<p>What you should always aim at is to obey the
spirit of an order rather than its letter. You
know Captain A. to be a reliable officer, and he
says that he fears that he cannot hold out until<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
10.30. If the enemy seize <i>A</i> trench before that
hour, not only will your retreat be cut off, but
the object of ordering A and B Companies to
hold the bridges so as to enable the main body
to get a good start will be defeated. The nearest
hostile infantry to you, at <i>E</i>, is some two
miles off, that is to say, some forty minutes’
march. In the circumstances it is your duty to
go to the assistance of A Company. The next
thing is to consider how you can best help him
to carry out his retirement and also how you
can best prevent the enemy from following up
your main body. If you were to march straight
to <i>A</i> wood, it is doubtful whether you would
help him very materially. The artillery firing
from the south of the river would deal with the
reinforcements you brought up and placed in <i>A</i>
trench, similarly to the way it dealt with B Company.
By far your better plan will be to march
as quickly as possible to <i>D</i> wood and occupy the
strong buildings at <i>D</i> farm. From the farm
buildings you will be able to prevent the enemy
marching along the road from <i>A</i> to <i>X</i>, and
should be able to comply with the spirit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
of the order, and by the delay you will thus
entail on the enemy’s movements you will be
able to effect the same purpose as if you had
actually prevented him from crossing <i>A</i> bridge
before 10.30. You should be able to hold on to
<i>D</i> farm until artillery are brought up to <i>A</i> wood,
and should then be able to slip away along the
road <i>B X</i>. Without aeroplane observation, hostile
artillery could not observe the effect of their
fire from the S. of the river, as trees intercept
their view.</p>

<h4><i>Orders.</i></h4>

<p>B Company will at once march to <i>D</i> wood and
occupy <i>D</i> farm.</p>

<h4><i>Order to Officer Commanding A Company.</i></h4>

<p>I am marching immediately to <i>D</i> farm, which
I hope to reach before 10 a.m. From this place
I shall be in a position to facilitate your retreat
and prevent your being pursued farther than <i>A</i>
wood. You may retire as soon as you see that
I have established myself in the farm buildings.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
Having accomplished the object for which we
have been sent out, I shall continue my retirement
to <i>X</i>.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>These twelve little schemes I have set you are,
as I think you will admit, all very simple, but
I am willing to wager that you have not answered
all of them correctly, even though they
were only applications of the axioms which I
gave in the letter which preceded them. The
difficulty is, in the heat of the moment, to decide
correctly which of the axioms deals with the
special situation, and nothing but practice will
get over this difficulty.</p>

<p>You should always take every opportunity
of discussing with your comrades little tactical
situations which have occurred, or those which
may occur. In talking over the former, do not
do so with the object of passing censure, but
merely with the view of learning what to do and
what not to do should you find yourself in a
similar situation.</p>

<p>Whenever you have an opportunity, carefully
explain the situation to your men. This is necessary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
if you expect them to co-operate intelligently
in bringing about your designs.</p>

<p>In the solution of any little scheme which
you may set to your subordinates, insist on definite
orders being given and do not be content
with vague disquisitions. When any little problem
which you have set has been unsatisfactorily
solved, let another leader fall in, take command,
and do it again properly. This is the best way
to ensure the proper solution being thoroughly
understood and remembered for application on a
future occasion. So long as you do not censure
a superior in front of his men, it is a good thing
to make your remarks in such a way that everybody
can hear them.</p>

<p>You must guard against technical instructors
giving wrong impressions. The bombing sergeant
is inclined to impress on the men that
there is no such weapon as the bomb. The instructors
in the rifle grenade and the Lewis gun
are also apt to talk so much of the value of the
weapons in which they instruct that their pupils
come away with very false ideas. The Lewis-gun
sergeant, although he never fails to tell the men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
that the Lewis gun can fire at the rate of 600
rounds a minute, very often does forget to inform
them that after firing 600 rounds it takes
twenty minutes or half an hour to cool before it
is capable of firing any more. It is all very well
for these men to be enthusiasts, but you must
see that they abide strictly by the truth and
avoid giving false impressions.</p>

<p>I will close this letter with a few remarks on
the moral forces. As Napoleon said, these are,
compared with the physical, as three is to one.
Men’s courage and determination and the will
to conquer are more than half the battle. The
situation to-day is no less serious than it was
when I ended the last of my Twelve Letters to
you, and it behoves you to devote the whole of
your time and your energy to making yourself
in every way efficient, and you must always bear
in mind that it is possible that the little action in
the winning or losing of which your right or
wrong decision may be the principal factor may
be the turning-point of a great battle.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
